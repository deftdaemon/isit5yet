# Is It Time to Go Home Yet?
A simple website that tells you if it's time to go home yet. Based on user's locale.

### Progress/To-Do  
~~Initial version and Github upload~~  
~~Implement a clock~~  
~~Implement a countdown~~  
Styling (WIP for mobile-friendliness)  
Message about Friday to ease pain of working (WIP - better code implementation)  
Custom end time, set by user (Default of 5:00 PM)  
Lunch timer, to try to break up the monotony of the day   

#### Credits
Thanks to Weston for the idea. Created so he can stop asking if it's 5:00 yet.  
Clock/countdown based on [Yaphi Berhanu's](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-javascript-countdown-timer-no-dependencies/) implementation.
